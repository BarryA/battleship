Mod 1 Paired Project

1. Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration?

The steps were broken down by thinking about how the game functions utilizing single responsibility principle and DRY. We realized that there needed to be a class that ran the game and a class that acted as an artificial player, then we broke it down from there. The game was broken down into each individual step taken while playing the game. 

2. If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?

We would work on Iteration 4. We were able to implement the intelligent AI portion of Iteration 4.

3. Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.

We did driver/navigator on huddles and communicated on Slack.

4. Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.

We talked on huddles instead of just using Github to communicate.
